# Note:
This repository contains a University team project. I can only take credit for 1/6th of the content and I have only uploaded here in order to build my portfolio.

We have included scripts for building and running the game.

** These scripts require that you are running Linux. **

The game uses Java 11, so make sure you have that set as your Java version.
JavaFX is included in the 'lib' directory, so you don't need to use your own installation of JavaFX.

Firstly, make sure your working directory is 'sabrewulf'.

To build the game:
 $ ./build.sh

To run the game:
 $ ./run.sh
